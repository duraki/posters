Collection of my fav art.



### Artic.edu

Just replace UUID with the protected one. To get a protected ID, right click on interested image, then Open Image in New Tab (ie. https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/<UUID>/full/843,/0/default.jpg). Go to https://dezoomify.ophir.dev/ and paste the link as the following:

https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/UUID/info.json


This trick works on literally all artic.edu collections, even if they are not in Public License.
